/*
Overview:
- Search game series (or any other searchable fields) to obtain a list of characters.
- User selects a character from the list to obtain detailed information of the character.

Rundown:
1. User running the app by executing:
	node cli.js search <keryword>
		Make sure we include the option to return cached results when available
			Ex: node cli.js search mario
	Make sure we include --help in cli.js
	node cli.js history to display a history of all previous searches

2. Perform search keyword with API, and record keyword into search_history.json
	For example, we would search game series:
        	- Game Series: Use /api/amiibo/?gameseries=value

3. Display SORTED search results and prompt user to select a character
	Ex:
		[ ] Baby Mario
		[ ] Mario
		[ ] Metal Mario
		etc...

4. If !cache:
    - Get item by ID from API: Use /api/amiibo/?id=value
    - Save entry in search_cache.json
    Else if cache:
    - Attempt to find item in search_cache.json
        - If not found, get item by ID from API: Use /api/amiibo/?id=value
            - Save entry in search_cache.json

5. Display detailed data
