Proposed rundown:
FEEDBACK #1
- This is taking on alot - you really only need to search by 1. Pick the best from this list - meaning the ones that provide the most interesting data from the API.
- This should not be a "Prompt"  this should be a cli command with a command arg.
---- node cli.js search <keryword> -> node cli.js search mario <optional cache flag>
1. Prompts the user to select search options:
    - Search by:
        - Name
        - Type
        - Game Series
        - Amiibo Series
        - Character

1.5??
FEEDBACK #1.5
- Missing saving to search_history.json
- search history contains the keyword in this case 'mario' and the results associated to 'mario'

FEEDBACK #1
- Here is where we "Prompt"
- Prompt user to select one of the results from the list related to the previous search in this example "mario".
2. User selects search option and enters keyword

FEEDBACK #3
- Not needed - see #1.
3. Performs search based on selected option and keyword
    - If search by:
        - Name:                                     Use /api/amiibo/?name=value
        - Type:                                     Use /api/amiibo/?type=value
        - Game Series:                              Use /api/amiibo/?gameseries=value
        - Amiibo Series:                            Use /api/amiibo/?amiiboSeries=value
        - Character                                 Use /api/amiibo/?character=value

FEEDBACK #4
- Saves to search_cache.json NOT search_history.json
- See #1.5
4. Gets response from API, saves search results in search_history.json

FEEDBACK #5
- Not needed as should be handled already.
- See #2.
5. Prompts user to select ONE item from the search results

FEEDBACK #6
- Logic is correct - BUT also see #1.
6. If !cache:
    - Get item by ID from API:                      Use /api/amiibo/?id=value
    - Save entry in search_cache.json
    Else if cache:
    - Attempt to find item in search_cache.json
        - If not found, get item by ID from API:    Use /api/amiibo/?id=value
            - Save entry in search_cache.json

FEEDBACK - Yes.
7. Display detailed data

FEEDBACK #8
- where is the history command??
- node cli.js history ??
